A little bit about me would probably be a good start. I'm Barry, in my thirties, I'm a father of two, a sysadmin and I live in the woods on the edge of civilisation. I'm a semi-retired goth DJ, who spent the majority of his twenties DJing in and around Edinburgh, eventually ending up as a resident at (probably) one of the most well known goth nights in Scotland. My blog can be found at [orodor.org.uk](http://www.orodor.org.uk) and I can be found on twitter as [@barryorourke](http://www.twitter.com/barryorourke).

I'm not a teenager anymore, at times I  may still feel like I am and I suspect that the majority of  *adults* do, but are too scared to admit it. Whilst I may mentally still feel like a teenager at times I've certainly aged physically and since hitting thirty have started to feel it too. I'm now fast approaching my mid-thirties (and my forties!) and have had mild right hemiplegia since birth, despite only learning I had it in my early twenties and only truly accepted it ten years after that.

I figured it would be fun to write some advice to a teenage version of me, with the knowledge that I've gained in the last two decades.

### Don't be silly, keep going to the physio ###

This is probably the biggest mistake that I have made! I grew up without a proper understanding of Cerebral Palsy and was encouraged from a very young age to be as *normal* as possible. In turn I ended up hating physio because it made me different so I stopped going as soon as I could which was as soon as I turned sixteen.

Abandoning the physio at such an active period of growth probably ended up causing the majority of the contracture that I have in my right leg.

### Educate yourself, be informed ###

Medical professionals can only help as far as their training can take them, and a lot of them will only know what they were taught back when they qualified. Things have changed a lot over the years so it's a really good idea to get out there are educate yourself as much as you can about every aspect of CP. 

When I started blogging nearly two years ago there wasn't much of an online community, recently I've been finding new forums and blogs pretty frequently. Sharing experiences and learning from others in a similar situation is often a lot better than the advice you'll get from a doctor with limited knowledge.


### Use it or lose it ###

This is really important, The more inactive you are, the more inactive you'll remain. A gym membership is a good start, get strong and stay strong, strengh will help loosen you up and give you an increased range of motion.

Learn as much as you can about mobility, and exerise as much as possible.

### Alchohol may appear to be your friend, but is not a friend you can rely upon ###

In my late teens I made a couple of alcohol related discoveries, firstly it had a positive affect upon my spasticity issues, making me feel looser and making me appear almost *normal* to the casual observer. In addition to this it gave me the confidence that the majority of teeangers, especially those with physical disabilities lack in.

However, ten years down the line and a little too much reliance on alchohol results in a much weaker affected side than I would like, you see the problem with alcohol is that it stops the production of the growth hormone that maintains muscle mass, in turn making you much weaker, which inevitably ends up with you drinking more to help deal with the issues that drinking creates.

Alcohol is dangerous, keep that in mind!
