Title: the greatest of evils, plus a few others
Tags: Primal, Hemiplegia
Status: draft

This is a follow-on post from my coverage of my attendance at the [FLOSS Spring Conference]({filename}/articles/floss_2014_1.md) and was mostly inspired from living for a week on a diet consisting of mostly grain and sugar, combined with an above average amount of alcohol.

I've wrote about alcohol quite extensively covering topics like [self medicating as a means of managing spasticity]({filename}/articles/spasticity.md), [why doing so is a bad idea]({filename}/articles/guest_post_cp_teens_uk.md) and the results of [not drinking for 21 days]({filename}/articles/21_days_no_alcohol.md). Alcohol isn't the greatest of evils, but it's certainly not angelic.

This leaves grain and sugar, grain is next up for discussion, or to be exact the gluten that it contains. Grain is something that I cut back on years ago to see what would happen, the results were positive. It took a week of eating grain again to remind myself the issues it causes the main one being a very upset stomach, I shall avoid going into too much details on the interweb, but after a few days it wasn't pretty and iot was a few times a day. Still, grain isn't the greatest of all evils, although it is often coupled with the greatest of all evils to create a tasty addictive, stomach pain inducing delight.

The greatest of all evils is of course sugar! There was a period of about six months were I abstained completly and I rejmember feeling fantastic, that was destroyed a couple of Christmases back by Christmas. However, I'd managed to keep it under control quite wekll until FLOSS. Sugar is interesting, if you avoid it for a while, it'll give you a headache, thats's obvious. The real issues are more subtle, it feeds my obsessive need for order, it makes me angry and in general isn't good for me or those close to me. **Sugar is the greatest of all evils, grain and alcohol are it's delivery systems**.

## The Solution

Readers of this blog before it was this blog, and most likely before it was that blog, will most loikely not remember that I wrote about the [primal lifestyle](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/definitive-guide-primal-blueprint), it's pretty simple really, it worked for me before and will again. It has some simple rules they're pretty straight forward;

* Eat lots of animals, insects and plants.
* Move around a lot at a slow pace.
* Lift heavy things.
* Run really fast every once in a while.
* Get lots of sleep.
* Play.
* Get some sunlight every day.
* Avoid trauma.
* Avoid poisonous things.
* Use your mind.

It can't be that hard right, it's just a case of not eating shit, get off my arse once in a while, relaxing and sleeping well.
