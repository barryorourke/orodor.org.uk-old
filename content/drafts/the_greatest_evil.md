Title: The Greatest Evil!

Status: draft

This is a follow-on post from my coverage of my attendance at the [FLOSS Spring Conference]({filename}/articles/floss_2014_1.md) and was mostly inspired from living for a week on a diet very different to what I'm used to. It was the standard conference diet, consisting of a vast amount of grain and sugar based delights, combined with a hell of a lot more alcohol than I'm used to consuming over a period of five days.

I've wrote about alcohol quite extensively  in the past covering topics such as [self medicating as a means of managing spasticity]({filename}/articles/spasticity.md), [why doing so is a bad idea]({filename}/articles/guest_post_cp_teens_uk.md) and the results of [not drinking for 21 days]({filename}/articles/21_days_no_alcohol.md). This post however, is not about alcohol, whilst it may have evil qualities, it isn't the greatest of all evils.

That leaves us with grain and sugar, grain is next up for discussion, or to be exact the gluten that it contains. Grain is something that I cut out of my diet about six years ago, the results at the time were very positive.

Sadly, it's quite easy to get sloppy and convince yourself it'll be alright this time and you'll be strict with yourself again tomorrow. It took a week of eating grain again to remind myself of the issues it caused me in the first place, the main one being a very upset stomach! I shall avoid going into too much details on the interweb, but after a few days it wasn't pretty and it was a few times a day. Is grain the greatest evil? It's not, although it is often coupled with the greatest of all evils to create a tasty, addictive, stomach pain inducing delight!

The greatest of all evils is of course sugar! There was a period of about six months were I abstained completly and I remember feeling fantastic. That was destroyed by overindulgence the following Christmas and in turn reintroduced my sugar addiction. Thankfully I kept it under control and didn't return to guzzling at least three chocolate bars a day, as I had done before my period of abstinence.

As with the grain I let myself get sloppy at FLOSS, which resulted in a lot of the nastier side-effects of sugar addiction rearing their ugly heads, such delights as increasing my already excessive need for order, and many of the symptoms that I experienced whilst drinking too much coffee like short temper,  lack of patientce and random bouts anger.

### The Solution

This blog has had a number of incarnations, any readers who were round for the one before the last one may well remember what I wrote about the [primal lifestyle](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/definitive-guide-primal-blueprint). 

It's pretty simple really, it worked for me before and will again!

* Eat lots of animals, insects and plants.
* Move around a lot at a slow pace.
* Lift heavy things.
* Run really fast every once in a while.
* Get lots of sleep.
* Play.
* Get some sunlight every day.
* Avoid trauma.
* Avoid poisonous things.
* Use your mind.

It can't be that hard, **it's just a case of not eating shit, getting off my arse once in a while, relaxing and sleeping well!**
