Title: the greatest of evils, plus a few others
Tags: Primal, Hemiplegia
Status: draft

This is a follow-on post from my coverage of my attendance at the [FLOSS Spring Conference]({filename}/articles/floss_2014_1.md) and was mostly inspired from living for a week on a diet consisting of mostly grain and sugar, combined with an above average amount of alcohol.

I've wrote about alcohol quite extensively covering topics like [self medicating as a means of managing spasticity]({filename}/articles/spasticity.md), [why doing so is a bad idea]({filename}/articles/guest_post_cp_teens_uk.md) and the results of [not drinking for 21 days]({filename}/articles/21_days_no_alcohol.md). Alcohol isn't the greatest of evils, but it's certainly not angelic.

This leaves grain and sugar, grain is next up for discussion, or to be exact the gluten that it contains.
