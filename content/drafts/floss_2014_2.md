Title: FLOSS 2014 (The Aftermath)
Tags: Primal
Status: draft


As I mentioned in my [previous post]({$filename}/articles/almost_dead_in_brighton.md}) I was attending the [FLOSS Spring Conference](www.flossuk.org/Events/Spring2014) last week. It was a good conference, but I must say that I'm glad to be back in the real world, I have no idea how the guys that seem to be premanently at conferences cope, especially those with young families.

Now that I'm back in the real world, I've decided that I need to get back into living a more [primal lifestyle](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/definitive-guide-primal-blueprint), living on conference food has highlighted a few things.

## Gluten intolerance

## Sugar is not my friend

## I don't excerise enough

## Get it sorted
