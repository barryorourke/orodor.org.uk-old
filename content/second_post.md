It's been roughly a year and a half since I made the decision to start blogging again and as you can see I've unpublished everything that I'd previously written with the exception of the first post. One of my biggest problems is, to paraphrase trainspotting, that I'm a bit of a perfectionist and if things aren't right I just can't be bothered. As far as I was concerned this site wasn't up to scratch so I decided to strip it back and start again.

I still intend to follow thought with my original plan of writing about living as an adult with Hemiplegia and my attempts at using exercise, nutrition and unconventional wisdom to hopefully help lessen the impact it has upon my life, but I also hope to write about other things that interest me too.

When I first started blogging about Hemiplegia I found it a bit odd to talk about, it's been a while, I've got over that and I fully accept Hemiplegia as part of life now. I realise that it'll never go away and the best I can do for the time being is to embrace it and counteract it as much as possible!

I plan to re-write most of my worthwhile old posts and add a load of new ones too over the next wee while so watch this space!
