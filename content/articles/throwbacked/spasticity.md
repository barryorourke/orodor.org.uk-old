This post is a rewrite of something that I wrote last time I started this blog, it dates back to April last year and will probably be the last repost, it forms the foundation of a lot of the other things that I would like to talk about so is probably quite an important post, which I imagine is why I've been putting it off!

Way back in the [First Post](first-post.html) I said I would write about the various symptoms of Hemiplegia and how they affect me personally, well what better place to start than the elephant in the living room? the source of the majority of my musculoskeletal issues and the most visible aspect of my Hemiplegia, otherwise known as spasticity.

> "Spasticity is a feature of altered skeletal muscle performance in muscle tone involving **hypertonia**; it is also referred to as an unusual "tightness", stiffness, and/or "pull" of muscles."

> "Hypertonia is a condition marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and a reduced ability of a muscle to stretch. It is caused by lesions to upper motor neurons in the central nervous system, which carry information from the central nervous system to the muscles and control posture, muscle tone, and reflexes." - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasticity)

As I mentioned in [my last post](what-is-hemiplegia.html), there were complications during my birth which resulted in me being deprived of oxygen, this in turn damaged the motor region of the cerebral cortex on the left hand side of my brain, and since brains work in reverse, that's how I ended up with right side hemiplegia.

Due to this damage my brain doesn't do a very good job of communicating what it wants the right hand side of my body to do, which results in it keeping the majority of my muscles tense when it tells them to relax. This in itself wouldn't be too bad if there were a way to consciously relax the muscles like I can with my unaffected side, but sadly that's not the case, it is very difficult to get them relaxed. 

Exercise and stretching help, but get complicated quite quickly, if you do too much it tires the muscles out and makes them tense, if you do it regularly then miss a day it makes them tense, if you don't do it enough and then do some it makes them tense. I've came to the conclusion that consistent exercise every day for the rest of my life is the only real solution, but sadly not all that easy to achieve!

Over the years I've self medicated using numerous substances, over the past few years the drug of choice has been alcohol, which whilst it helped the muscles relax I neglected the most important fact, that one of the side-effects of alcohol consumption is that it stops the body being able to produce growth hormones which keeps muscles strong, in turn making things worse!

Since majorly cutting back on alcohol, my latest attempt at spasticity control has combined walking at least three miles per day, with stretching, staying relaxed, lifting weights three times per week. On top of that I take about seven different supplements and eat a diet that aims to avoid inflammation which is spasticity's mortal enemy! 

Things seem to be working out quite well under this regime, I'll share my reasoning and experiences in future posts!
