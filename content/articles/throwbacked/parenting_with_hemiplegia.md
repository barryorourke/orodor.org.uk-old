Title: Parenting with Hemiplegia

If you've read my shiny new [About]({filename}/pages/about.md) page that's only taken the last twenty months to write, you will already know that I'm a father of two, four year old Hazel and three week old Robin.

I've had this post in mind since Robin was born, and am currently writing it with him resting on my affected arm! I thought it would be quite interesting to start a series of posts about being a parent with hemiplegia and following it through the various development stages that he goes through.

When Hazel was a baby I used to laugh at people who told me that looking after babies was hard, she slept for 10 hours a night from three weeks old, hardly cried and was happy with pretty much whatever life threw at her, either that or I'm romantising her newbornism! Robin on the other hand is a demanding wee fellow, he likes cuddles, milk and sleep, anything else makes him angry, very angry, and don't even think about putting him down, he only allows that for 3 minutes 42 seconds, if you're lucky! 

Considering that all that newborns really do is sleep, eat and shit, you would think that they would be quite easy to look after, however I'm quickly learning the opposite and for the first time in my life Hemiplegia has been causing a few issues that I haven't been able to work around yet.

### Increased spasticity ###

I wrote about [spasticity]({filename}/articles/spasticity.md) in my last post.

Over the last month I've noticed that I've tightened up quite a lot, there are a number of things that have contributed to this;

The most obvious of which is sleep deprivation, which probably doesn't come as much of a surprise! Robin tends to eat every three hours, whilst Anna deals with most of the late night feeds I've been getting up at seven to have him sleep on me whilst she gets a proper rest without his early morning grunting!

As I mentioned, Robin likes to make use of his lungs, and does so quite often. One of the things that I've not spoke before on the blog is about how badly spasticity is affected by excessive sensory stimulation. I've never coped well in situations where too may people talk at once, if people talk over each other or if too many people talk at once. It appears that I can now add having a baby scream at me for a while to the list.

One other thing that affects spasticity is stress, any parent who says their newborn didn't cause them any stress at all is a liar, it's a stressful time adjusting to parenthood even if it is your second child.

Finally, I've been making a lot more use of my affected side whilst holding and walking Robin around, and guess what increased usage increases spasticity too.

### Robin's response to spasticity ###

One of the things that is bothering me the most at the moment is Robin's response to my increased muscle tone, he seems to sense it whilst I'm holding him and I suspect that one of his instincts tells him that if the person that is holding his is tense that there must be something wrong. Whilst at my tightest I don't seem to be able to calm him or get him to sleep at all which is really frustrating, and of course, frustration increases spasticity!

### Positive stuff ###

All of the above must make being a parent with Hemiplegia sound a bit negative so I thought I'd cheat a little and write about some of the positive affects upon my Hemiplegia that I can remember from when Hazel was a baby.

The most obvious was my increase in strength from carrying her about all the time up until she was well over a year old, I imagine the same will happen this time around! Whilst carrying Hazel I used my affected side to support her weight and my unaffected side to support and catch her should she decide to drop backwards.

Another positive from carrying her about was that the dexterity in my arm increased, I found that I could do more with it simply because I was using it more. That could be because the increased strength allowed more control, I've read that somewhere before I'm sure!
