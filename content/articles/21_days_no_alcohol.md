I wrote a couple of days ago about how rather than having following the resolutions path this year, I decided to conduct a series of n=1 experiments over [twenty-one days]({filename}/articles/twenty_one_days.md). For my first experiment I decided that I would stop drinking alcohol.

I've had an interesting relationship with alcohol over the years dating back to my teenage years, where unlike the majority of Scottish teenagers, I just wasn't interested in drinking at all. In my twenties, after taking voluntary redundancy and setting myself up as a DJ in Edinburgh, I went the opposite direction and was partying up to six nights a week to the point that it became a problem. After settling down and retiring from DJing, consumption also settled down and as I blogged about before, I started using alcohol as a counter to the [spasticity]({filename}/articles/spasticity.md) caused by Hemiplegia.

There are a number of reasons I decided to make not drinking my first experiment. The biggest factor being that I felt my body needed a break after the Christmas holidays, followed closely by wanting to conduct an experiment based on something I read. 

As I mentioned above I've been using alcohol to deal with spasticity, it does lessen the effect and during bad spells has helped a lot. However, I've noticed a drastic drop in muscle mass over the last couple of years and that got me thinking. It turns out that alcohol blocks several growth hormones, in particular ones that take care of repairing your body as you sleep.

So my theory was that **by using alcohol to deal with spasticity, I was actually making the spasticity worse** by lessening my muscle mass.

Was I right? I'm pretty sure that I was, I've noticed that I'm feeling a lot more stable, stronger and may have noticed a slight increase in mass. Admittedly, I have been doing the [200 squats in a day](www.twohundredsquats.com) training program at the same time, but that's pretty much cancelled out by the fact that I've not been walking as much as usual.

Will I start drinking alcohol again? Yes, but nowhere near as frequently as before and with the knowledge that it will not help my spasticity in the long run!
