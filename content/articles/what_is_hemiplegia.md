According to my medical records I have Hemiparesis, according to some people that's the same as Hemiplegia, according to others it's a less severe form. To add to that both of those can be either congenial, which means that you got it before you were two, or acquired which means you got it later. Congenial Hemi{paresis,plegia} is also classified as Cerebral Palsy, where as acquired is considered a neurological condition.

It appears to get more complicated the more people you involve, but at the end of the day Hemiplegia is a form of Cerebral Palsy, in which only one side of the body it affected, it is generally caused by injuries and abnormalites of the brain, usually damage to the motor control center.

> "Symptoms can include spasticities, spasms, other involuntary movements, unsteady gait, problems with balance, and/or soft tissue findings consisting largely of decreased muscle mass. Scissor walking and toe walking are common among people with CP who are able to walk. The effects of cerebral palsy fall on a continuum of motor dysfunction which may range from slight clumsiness at the mild end of the spectrum to impairments so severe that they render coordinated movement virtually impossible at the other end the spectrum." - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemiplegia)

Whilst true, this misses a lot of the more subtle physiological and psychological issues which seem to vary quite a lot between people who have the various forms of Cerebral Palsy, which makes sense really as the brain is a complex piece of kit and everyone of us has brain damage in different areas!

Personally, I have mild right sided hemiplegia, which came about due to shortage of oxygen and some sort of fit shortly after birth, I have the spasticity described above, heightened reflexes, my right leg is a few centimetres shorter than my left, a variety of hypersensitivity issues and no doubt a few things I've yet to discover are CP related!
