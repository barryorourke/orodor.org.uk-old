As I mentioned previously, I've recently switched back to using Pelican to generate this site. It's a static site generator geared towards blogs and in turn doesn't have the ability to handle comments out of the box.

There are a few options available that provide commenting systems that Pelican can work with.

## Disqus

http://www.disqus.com/

## Moot.it

## Isso

http://posativ.org/isso/

## Static Comments
