As I mentioned previously, I've recently switched back to using Pelican to generate this site. It's a static site generator geared towards blogs and in turn doesn't have the ability to handle comments out of the box.

There are a few options available that provide commenting systems that Pelican can work with.

## External Providers

There are numberous external providers that offer the option of embedding their commenting system into your blog. The biggies include the obvious [Disqus](http://www.disqus.com), [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com) and [Google Plus](https://developers.google.com). Whilst out of the box systems like these are as easy to set up as a copy and paste of some javascript into you template files, they are not for me. One of the reasons that I switched to Pelican was so that I could get away from relying on the external companies.

One honourable mention in this category however, is [Muut](https://moot.it), they don't appear to be evil and their feature set is quite impressive.
