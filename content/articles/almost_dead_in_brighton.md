This is the first of many posts where I hope to reminise, this one brought about by the fact that I'll be living down in Brighton for the next week whilst I attend the [FLOSS Spring Conference](www.flossuk.org/Events/Spring2014). 

My last visit to Brighton was roughly twelve years ago, back when I was in my early twenties, when I was a very different person!

It was probably one of the periods where I made some of most important descisions of my life, I'd just left a job that I hated, taking advantage of voluntary severence and a five figure bank balance.

The sensible thing to do would have been to sink my cash into the birth of web 2.0, but instead I set myself up as a club promoter and goth DJ. My life revolved around getting wasted and fucking randoms, getting to the point where I was pretentious enough to wear a t-shirt that proclaimed "Fuck me, I'm a DJ!".

Anyway, back to the Brighton story, and the weekend I nearly died!

Fraze and I decided to visit Neil and Leo who had set themselves up in Brighton in the previous year. During our visit we lived on a diet of noodles and whiskey, but it was alright, we offset the alcohol with probiotic yoghurts!

It was the final day of the weekend that warrants documentation, it was the night I opted to stay in, in retrospect this was probably caused by starvation.  The lure of a bottle of whiskey and a rather attractive Irish girl soon got me out the house and gave me an adopted Irish accent, and an Irish girl with an adopted Scots accent.

At some point during the evening after the consumption of far too much whiskey and buckfast, the afore-mentioned Irish girl, a few others and I decided to sit on the roof and for a wee smoke, the smoke that in turn caused me to roll to my almost death, only just being grabbed by the Irish girl as I almost fell four stories to my death!!!

It's sad that I can't remember her name, she saved my life, and I can't remember!
