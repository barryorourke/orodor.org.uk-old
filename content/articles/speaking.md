Title: Speaking

The last time I properly did a presentation was back some time around 1995. I remember the day well, it was a presentation shared with my friend Matt most likely something to do with basketball. It was a presentation that went horribly wrong, that put me off doing another to the extent that I skipped college of the day I was meant to present, and in turn failed the course. Back to second year English and the fact that the whole class knew I couldn't pronounce Massachusetts. Matt knew I was dreading the questions, yet they asked it, they directed it at me, and he didn't save me!

That's not the sole reason that I dread public speaking, I covered the other major one in my recent post about [FLOSS 2014]({{filename}}/articles/floss_2014_1.md), it all comes down to the insecurities caused growing up with [Hemiplegia]({filename}/articles/what_is_hemiplegia.md)! Hemiplegia is a funny beast, it translates any uncomfortable thought into physical tension almost instantly, and that in turn becomes jiggly, spastic movement, which in turn causes mental anguish and the cycle begins again. As I mentioned in my previous post, I've been working on not caring about it over the last couple of years, yet at the same time the previous years of conditioning are still there and I'm still self-conscious, even if to a lesser degree.

The inspiration behind this post is that I've been asked to do a presentation about my monitoring system at work, it consists of a combination of [Sensu](http://www.sensuapp.org), [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com), [Dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing) and [Grafana](http://www.grafana.org) and is coming along nicely enough to have gathered interest from other parts of the University.

I should have expected it really, considering my some-what inebriated announcement at FLOSS that I was going to do so. 

I know I should really just get on with it and do my best, but in this case I've decided to opt-out for a number of reasonably sensible reasons.

* I care about the work I've been doing and don't want to present it in a bad way due to inexperience.
* It's terrifying and I'd rather start presenting to smaller groups first.
* I've got a lot on over the next couple of months with other projects and this years exams are fast approaching.

It's almost a copout, but it's justified enough in my mind for me to get away with it!
