The last time I properly did a presentation was back some time around 1995. I remember the day well, it was a presentation shared with my friend Matt most likely something to do with basketball. It was a presentation that went horribly wrong, that put me off doing another to the extent that I skipped college of the day I was meant to present, and in turn failed the course. Back to second year english and the fact that the whole class knew I couldn't pronounce Massachusetts. Matt knew I was dreading the questions, yet they asked it, they directed it at me, and he didn't save me!

That's not the sole reason that I dread public speaking, I covered the other major one in my recent post about [FLOSS 2014]({{filename}}/articles/floss_2014_1.md), it all comes down to the insecurities caused growing up with [Hemiplegia]({filename}/articles/what_is_hemiplegia.md)! Hemiplegia is a funny beast, it translates any uncomfortable thought into physical tension almost instantly, and that in turn becomes jiggly, spastic movement, which in turn causes mental anguish and the cycle begins again. As I mentioned in my previous post, I've been working on bnot caring about it over the last couple of years, yet at the same time the previous years of conditioning are still there and I'm still self-consious, even if to a lesser degree.

The inspiration behind this post is that I've been asked to do a presentation about my monitoring system at work, which consists of a combination of [Sensu](http://www.sensuapp.org), [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com), [Dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing) and [Grafana](http://www.grafana.org). I should have expected it really, considering my promising everyone I would whilst mildly inebreated in Brighton.

Hopefully noone will remember how I swore about talking about [LCFG](http://www/lcfg.org) at next years [Configuration Management Camp](http://cfgmgmtcamp.eu).

It would appear that I have a few choices.

* I could just deal with it an do the presentation.
* I could do the presentation alongside a colleage.
* I could turn down the offer.

Deep down I know what needs to be done, but agreeing to do it and getting started is the hard part. At the end of the day it will be beneficial to me and you never know, I might just end up talking about configuration managment, somewhere on the continent in 2015!
