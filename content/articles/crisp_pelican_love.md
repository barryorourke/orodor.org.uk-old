Title: Crisp, Pelican Love

Ever since switching to using [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com) I've been a much better blogger, my monthly post count has at least quadrupled. I put this down to the fact that Pelican lets me follow a much simpler workflow, similar to what I do on a daily basis as a developer and sysadmin. I write my posts using [vim](http://www.vim.org), version control them in [git](https://www.github.com/barryorourke/orodor.org.uk) and publish them using [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make). It goes to show that the Unix philosophy is always the best approach!

A few weeks back I announced on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/barryorourke) that I intended to feed something back to the Pelican community and I've been pondering it since then. I had originally decided to add my theme into the [pelican-themes](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes) repository on github, but my perfectionism led me down a path which resulted in it becoming a shambles.

A couple of nights back I had the urge to rewrite my theme, which led me to take a look at the Ghost's [Theming Forum](https://ghost.org/forum/themes), which always seems to attract some really good designers. It was there that I came across the [Crisp Ghost Theme](https://github.com/kathyqian/crisp-ghost-theme) and promptly ported it into what has become the [Crisp Pelican Theme](https://github.com/barryorourke/pelican-crisp-theme), it's still a work in progress, but I thought I'd get it out there and see what happened.
