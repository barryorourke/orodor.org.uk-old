It's been a very long time since I posted anything on here, especially something hemiplegia related.

I'm quite the procrastinator, so it's no surprise that this is a partial follow up to a [brace yourselves]({filename}/brace_yourselves.md), which I wrote way back November last year.

It took a while to get everything into place, but I eventually got myself a standing desk. Rather than replacing my main desk I opted to replace one of my smaller desks so that I could switch between sitting and standing as required.
