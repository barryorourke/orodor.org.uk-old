Title: FLOSS 2014
Tags: Work, Programming, Hemiplegia

This is the first of two posts that I've been compiling from my experiences over the last week which I spent in Brighton at [FLOSS Spring Conference](www.flossuk.org/Events/Spring2014). 

This year was my third year in attendance so it was very good to catch up with some of the regulars and to get to know some of the other attendees. There were a few of us from the [University of Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk) in attendance, Kenny has also blogged about his experiences [over here](http://blog.inf.ed.ac.uk/kenny).

I started off the week with the intention of taking notes. However, after the first day it became clear that carrying a laptop around for the majority of the week would end up being rather tedious and no doubt result in being on the receiving ends of the dregs of lunch. My minimal notes can be found in my [experiments and notes](https://github.com/barryorourke/experiments-and-notes/tree/master/notes/floss2014) repository on github.

I've been attending FLOSS conferences for the last three years now and must admit that this is the first that hasn't resulted in me walking away with a new project. Last year inspired me to replace my existing virtualisation platform with a combination of [CEPH](http://www.ceph.com) and [Opennebula](http://www.opnnebula.org), the previous year was what inspired my monitoring system mash-up which involves [Sensu](http://www.sensupapp.org), [Graphite](https://github.com/graphite-project/graphite-web), [Grafana](https://github.com/torkelo/grafana) and [Dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing).

The lack of new project concerned me briefly but in retrospect it's actually a good thing, it doesn't mean that I got nothing out of the conference, it translates to me being well informed and up to date! It also means that I don't need to add another project to the list, since the last two are still under construction.

### Highlights from the talks

#### Make things open, it makes them better - Paul Downey

Paul works for the government, I must admit I was pleasantly surprised to hear that they are not only embracing open source, but also agile development, [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and [nginx](http://nginx.org).

#### What's New in OpenLDAP - Howard Chu

I'll admit now that I had no intention of seeing this talk as I had suspected it would be too low level. However, I'm glad I did, It was interesting to hear about the latest updates and in particular the licensing issues now affecting older versions. As a sysadmin running an RHEL derivative, I can see myself packaging a newer version for these very reasons, when it comes to our roll-out later in the year.

#### Building and Deploying MediaSalsa - Kris Buytaert

As someone who was involved in the early days of drupal and someone with a healthy interest in the devops movement, I found this quite interesting, yet at the same time it didn't cover any new ground. It did however highlight the need for better inter-team communication at work.

#### Perl: Apparent in Spite of Exaggeration - Mark Keating

In my opinion Mark should have left the conference winning both Raspberry Pi's awarded for best talks, it was an entertaining look at modern perl and also convinced me that perl shouldn't be discredited.

### Lessons learnt

#### It's OK to be a polyglot

I tend to jump from one language to another at least once a month, for some reason I used to think that there should be one language to rule them all. I was wrong, there is nothing wrong with being a polyglot, there's nothing wrong with being competent in [Python](http://www.python.org), [Perl](http://www.perl.org), [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and even [Javascript](http://nodejs.org) all at the same time. It took a few heated discussions to reach this conclusion and **this also applies to configuration management systems by the way!** 

#### Speaking anxiety sucks!

This is the most important realisation from this year's conference. I really need to deal with my anxiety issues relating to public speaking. 

This is a tricky one to explain, for the first time reader it would serve you well to read about my [Hemiplegia]({filename}/articles/what_is_hemiplegia.md). It was something that made me very self-conscious for the first thirty or so years of my life and something that is more prominent when I'm nervous, which in turn makes public speaking into a big bowl of jiggly, self-conscious, scary soup. I've been getting over it the past few years to the point I can present to a handful of people, but the thought of more than that terrifies me. 

I've decided that the first step is to share the fact with the world, in the hope that it makes it easier since everybody knows!
