Title: Giving Up The Ghost
Tags: Blogging, Programming

In the last five months this blog has migrated from [Wordpress to Pelican]({filename}/articles/goodbye_wordpress_hello_pelican.md) then from [Pelican to Ghost]({filename}/articles/came_back_haunted.md) and I've been at it again, along with redesigning the look of the site, I've also migrated back to [Pelican](http://www.getpelican.com).

There are a number of reasons for this;

* I've discovered that I really don't like Javascript and since Ghost is a [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org) application, it had to go.
* I've discovered that [Python](http://www.python.org) is a fantastic language and Pelican is written in Python.
* Over the last couple of months I've become quite a competent Python programmer after making it my main language at work.
* The Pelican community seem a lot friendlier than the Ghost community.

The only thing that could possibly cause me to be tempted to migrate again is my recent discovery that I quite enjoy programming in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org).
