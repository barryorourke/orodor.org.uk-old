The last month or so has been pretty interesting, hence the lack of any posts. We've seen a couple of viruses (or is that virii) make their way around the family and Robin had the misfortune of cuttin his first two teeth at the same time, so sleep has been broken and limited.

It's quite frustrating as I made a rather good start to the year with the [21 days of no alcohol]({filename}/articles/21_days_no_alcohol.md) and had a shitload of other plans that the illness and teething put an end to quite quickly. 

There were a couple of things that I've been meaning to write up so i'll get that out the way now for the sake of completion, and normal blogging shall resume shortly afterwards.

### 21 days - no coffee

I had just finished this experiment when the first of the viruses set in, the premise behind it was to discover just how much of an effect coffee was having on my mood. Over the previous months I had noticed that I was a lot grumpier than usual and my temper was getting shorter.

I didn't even need to cplet the twenty-one days to prove my point and I decided after the first week that I wouldn't be drinking it any more.

What confuses me about coffee the most is how it's almost worshiped within the Paleo community, a community that usually advises against consuming things that have minimal side-effects.

### 200 squats in a day challenge

I decided at the start of January to see if taking part in the [200 squats in a day](http://www.twohundredsquats.com) training program to see if it would help with spasticity issues. I made it all the way through to week five before the illnesses set in and was starting to find it quite tough.

Saying that I had doubled the amount of squats that I could do in one set and had reached somewhere between seventy and eighty. I was feeling a lot stronger and experiencing less of the issues that I would usually associate with spasticity. I've been noticing the issues sneaking back in after three weeks of doing very little, so it does help!

### What now?

Now that the illnesses have passed and this bout of teething is almost over I would really like to get back to work with the strength and mobility training. I'd also like to get back into living a more [primal lifestyle](http://www.marksdailyapple.com/definitive-guide-primal-blueprint), something that slipped when Robin was born. 

I'm off to Brighton next week for the [FLOSS Spring Conference](http://flossuk.org/Events/Spring2014), so I'll aim to make a start upon my return!
