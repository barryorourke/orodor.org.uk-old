Title: Brace Yourselves

It's been almost a month since I first posted about becoming a parent [for the second time]({filename}/articles/parenting_with_hemiplegia.md) so I figured an update was in order. 

Robin is now fast approaching ten weeks old and is getting used to the world at quite a steady pace, he is thankfully past the stage of needing to be held permanently, he's even managed to fall asleep a few times without being rocked. Saying that he is still partial to a wee listen to [his favourite song](www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KaOrSuWZeM) when he's grumpy and tired, but that's what babies do!

Whilst he may have aged just four weeks since my last post about him, I feel like I've aged about forty or so years. I have pain in my lower back and hips, the majority of my leg muscles have tightened up and it aches to move. It appears that the combination of sitting too much and the increased spasticity that colder weather brings is not a very happy one. I've decided to get my arse in gear and remedy this as soon as I can.

The main purpose of this post is so to make myself publically accountable, here's what I plan to do;

### The Gym ###

I used to *beast* the gym up to four times a week in my early twenties, and combined with all the dancing I used to do whilst out clubbing it left me pretty flexible. I stopped going when my gym moved to newer premises and replaced all the kit with new fangled computerised stuff that I didn't like. It turns out that a three month membership to the gym at my work costs the same as one month at a *normal* gym, so I signed up. I've not been along yet as I'm a little scared of hurting myself since I'm so tight at the moment.

### Staying Active ###

Apart from the three mile round trip I walk every day to get to nearest bus stop the majority of my day is spent sitting. It's not exactly the best time of year to start adding an extra miles worth of walking in over my lunch hour, but it's probably a good idea. I'll start doing that every day that I don't go to the gym.

### Mobility ###

I've been trying to get up and stretch at least once an hour, and fit in random stretches whilst waiting for the bus and the like. What I really need to do is start working my way through [MobilityWOD](http://www.mobilitywod.com) again, as that has really helped in the past. I only just discovered the [MovNat](http://www.movnat.com) Journal, it's worth looking into too.

### Standing ###

Another thing I've been toying with the idea of recently is getting myself a standing desk at work and using it for at least part of the day.
