Slug: 21days

At the beginning of the year I wrote a seven-hundred word post detailing my intended new years resolutions. However, after proof reading it a couple of times I came to the conclusion that whilst it was a reasonable list of goals, it was also pretty pointless. 

Resolutions never work out for me, anyone who has followed this blog through it's numerous incarnations will know that I can be  a terrible procrastinator at times, which is why that post was quickly deleted.

Instead of putting the ideas out there, then never getting round to completing them I've decided to _get shit done_ and write about the experiences instead. 

I intend to spend a lot of time this year changing habits and conducting a number of twenty-one day n=1 experiments, I'll be finished the first of many at the end of the week and will write about it shortly after.

Why twenty-one days? because according to a lot of people on the internet, it takes twenty-one days to create or break a habit. Some other people on the internet disagree with this, but I like the idea so I'm sticking with it.
