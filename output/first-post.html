    <p>Welcome to the latest incarnation of my blog, a few of the previous attempts didn't go too well but I'm hoping things will be different this time around. This time I decided that it should be a little more focused and in turn have decided that I would like to write about my experiences living as an adult with Hemiplegia (which is a form of Cerebral Palsy), it will also cover my attempts at using exercise, nutrition and unconventional wisdom to hopefully help lessen the impact it has upon my life.</p>
<p>I must admit that I find it rather strange announcing that I have a form of CP to the Internet, it's not something that I've ever really discussed with my friends and family properly, only really mentioning it briefly over the last couple of years. Don't get me wrong though it's not something I'm ashamed of, it's more that I've just never let it bother or affect me to the point that I've needed to discuss it and because of that people have either not noticed or saw that it doesn't bother me so never felt the need to bring it up.</p>
<p>Why should I start to care now then? I've always been pretty active and generally quite well exercised until this winter when the convenience of Internet grocery shopping and a new biomass heating system saved me the hassle of chopping wood for five hours per week and cycling three miles every Saturday. Over the past couple of months I've started noticing aches and pains that weren't there before and in turn have taken to googling around to see how other people cope with the it. The result wasn't too positive as it appears that there isn't really much information out there for adults with CP, so I thought it would be a worthwhile learning experience for me to investigate it myself and that by documenting my experiences I may be able to help out other people in a similar situation.</p>
